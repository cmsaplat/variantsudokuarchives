<h1>Welcome to the <i>Variant Sudoku Archives</i>!</h1>

<p>Perhaps you have seen a Sudoku with numbers outside of the grid,
   or Sudokus with squiggly green or magenta lines, and these unexplained symbols
   have caused you some great confusion and intimidation. You already need to fill
   a 9x9 grid with a whopping 81 numbers--and now you have to worry about drawings
   too?!
<br><br>Thankfully, these symbols really aren't as scary as an out-of-context peek
      may make them appear to be. In reality, these symbols are usually the mark
      of aÂ Sudoku Variant--which is usually a puzzle that follows some classic sudoku
      rules (if you're unfamiliar with them see <i>Classic Sudoku Rules</i>), with a few
      extra rules that you wouldn't see in its traditional form.
      Sudoku players love these variants--they show up in online puzzle hunts, puzzle
      community servers, and even Sudoku world championships!
<br><br>This website aims to introduce newer players to these variants through
      approachable Sudokus (all set by the lovely <i>clover!</i>, with the exception
      of one <i>Sam Capppleman-Lynes</i>), giving brief descriptions and tips for the
      most commonly found Sudoku variants.</p>
<br><br><p>If you find the idea of variant sudokus intimidating, then I highly recommend looking
 at some media involving said puzzles. Have a try at this <i>Cracking the Cryptic</i> video;
 all of the puzzles are approachable on their own, as well as accompanied by a solver if you
 ever get stuck.</p>

<br><br><p class="rules">Please note that the variants on this website are not a comprehensive
      list of all Sudoku variants--they simply describe the most common variants and/or
      the basis for more unique ones.</p>
<p class="rules">Also note that <strong>variants only apply when specified</strong>.
  They cannot be used on rulesets that do not specify them as a constraint.</p>
