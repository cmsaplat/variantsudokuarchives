<h1>Visual Cue Sudoku Variants</h1>

<p>Perhaps you've seen a sudoku that doesn't apply to any of the variants covered above--some
  of the digits may be highlighted, there might be lines with bulbs, there's dots--the
  list of their variety is endless. Thankfully, there's some common variants that
  are must-knows in the sudoku community; these will be explained in the articles
  below.</p>

<ol class="categories" style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li><a href="#thermo">Thermo</a></li>
<li><a href="#kropki">Kropki/Consecutive</a></li>
<li><a href="#fortress">Fortress</a></li>
<li><a href="#extra">Extra Regions</a></li>
<li><a href="#irregular">Irregular</a></li>
</ol>

<br><br><h2 id="thermo">Thermo</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, digits along a bulbed line
  (commonly referred to as thermometers) must be in increasing order. Digits may not
  repeat on thermometers.
<br>+ There are exceptions to the last sentence, specifically slow thermos. This
  allows digits to repeat on thermometers, as long as it's still in ascending order.</p>
<div class="hints">
<p class="parappa">The main aspect of thermo sudokus is immediate elimination: notably that 1s can
  only go on the bulb end of a thermo, and 9s can only go on the tip. Most
  beginner-level sudokus will use this kind of elimination.
<br><br>There's also a general restrictive property on thermos. Let's look at the
  diagram below as an example:</p>
<img class="m region" src="dia/thermodia1.png" alt="Thermo Diagram High">
<p class="parappa">Because thermos can only go in increasing order from the bulb, the digit on the tip
  must be 8--this is the only digit higher than 7 that's still valid in this region
  (see the given 9).
<br><br>The reverse is true for lower digits:</p>
<img class="m region" src="dia/thermodia2.png" alt="Thermo Diagram Low">
<p class="parappa">The only digit lower than 2 is one, so the bulb of this thermo
  must contain said digit 1.</p>

</ol>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="kropki">Kropki/Consecutive</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, digits connected by a white
  dot are consecutive to each other, and digits connected by a black dot must be in a
  1:2 ratio.
<br>+ Some consecutive/kropki sudokus may include a rule known as a "negative
  constraint"--that is, no orthogonally adjacent** cells except those indicated may
  be consecutive/in a 1:2 ratio. If this is not written down, then it's implied that
  unindicated cells may be consecutive to/in a 1:2 ratio with each other.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, these are two different variants, but because they're
  so commonly used in tandem, it would be easier to explain these in the same
  article.</p>
<div class="hints">
<p class="parappa">Firstly, kropki, i.e. the black dots. There are two special restraints that
  come with this variant:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>For kropki strings that are three cells long, both a 2 and 4 must go into them.
  This is because three cell long strings must either be 1/2/4, or 2/4/8.</li>
<li>The digits 5, 7, and 9 cannot go into a kropki, no matter what. This doesn't have
  as many applications, but some setters may play around with this restriction, so it's
  still important to keep in mind. </li>
</ol>
<p class="parappa">Secondly, consecutive, i.e. the white dots. There aren't many
  strategies for consecutive dots other than common sense, but there are some strange
  uses for them that may come in handy when you seek out sudoku solving.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Setters will occasionally use consecutive dots in straight chains. In this case,
  any given digits in the chain's column/row can be used for deductive purposes: if
  a digit is given inside the chain, then you can figure out the rest of the digits
  inside the chain (which normally come in pairs); if a digit is given outside of the
  chain, it can be used to rule out any chains that would need to use said digit.</li>
<li>For lack of better phrasing, the "stairwell effect"--see the example puzzle given
  below. These are good for finding the cells immediately around digits--however,
  things can get messy if you solely rely on them for progress, so it's best to use
  them as hints appear/to disambiguate, and then continue.</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="fortress">Fortress</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, the digits in shaded cells
  must be greater than its adjacent neighbours.</p>
<div class="hints">
<p class="parappa">On paper, the logic behind fortress sudokus are easy enough to follow: the lowest
  digits in a column, row, or region can never be inside a shaded cell; likewise the
  highest in said regions can never be adjacent to a shaded cell.
<br><br>The difficulty arises when you're putting that logic into context. The best way
  to work around this is to consider the fortress as not just the shaded cell, but the
  adjacent cells around it. Take the following visual as an example:</p>
<img class="m region" src="dia/fortressdia2.png" alt="Full Fortress Inside a Region">
<p class="parappa rules">+ In this instance, the whole fortress in contained inside one
  region--but if you have a fortress that crosses over regions, it's best to just
  consider the region that contains the most fortress cells.</p>
<p class="parappa">Notice the shaded cell (i.e., the cell with arrows) in the middle.
  This must be greater than at least 4 digits. Also notice that digits 6, 7, 8, and 9
  are taken; this leaves digits 12345. 5 is the only digit greater than the remaining
  4 digits, and so, must be the digit in the shaded cell.</p>

</ol>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="extra">Extra Regions</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, fill every shaded region
  with the digits 1-9.</p>
<div class="hints">
<p class="parappa">There are two core strategies for extra regions.
<br><br>The first is realising that, because the shaded region must also be filled
  with digits 1-9, it is susceptible to column and row restraints. See the image below
  as an example:</p>
<img class="m special" src="dia/extredia1.png" alt="Elimination by Columns">
<p class="parappa">The second is realising that both normal <i>and</i> extra regions
  are forced to coexist. Both must contain the digits 1-9--this means that, in
  specific cases of overlap, you can eliminate digits in specific areas of an extra
  region.</p>
<img class="m" style="width:27%;height:80%;align:left;margin-left:0%;" src="dia/extredia2.png" alt="Regional Deduction">
<p class="parappa">In the case of this image, the 1, 2, and 3 can't go into the shaded
  2x2 inside its own region, so they must go on the outside edge of the extra region.
  Likewise, the extra region's 4 and 5 can't go in that same 2x2 square, so they must
  go into the unshaded area of the upper left box.</p>

</ol>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="irregular">Irregular</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. However, some or all regions are
  irregularly shaped (i.e., not 3x3 squares).</p>
<p>I believe that a warning is in place. This variant is one of the hardest to explain--
  mainly because there's infinite possibilities for irregular regions, and you will
  need to see the <i>unique</i> relationships between a given sudoku's regions--something
  that pure memorising will not prepare you for. For this reason, this article will
  not be giving you information--rather, it will be explaining a way of thinking
  about irregular regions.</p>
<div class="hints">
<p class="parappa">The common link between all irregular sudokus is column and row
  constraints. Regions will usually be designed around these restrictions. Let's go
  through an example of this structure:</p>
<img class="m special" src="dia/irregdia1.png" alt="Irregular Row Deduction">
<p class="parappa">You can fill in the rest of the middle with digits 5-9. Because
  this row also happens to be part of a <i>region</i> (the central cross), you can
  fill in the rest of the region like so:</p>
<img class="m special" src="dia/irregdia2.png" alt="Filling in Regions">
<p class="parappa">You may notice that the 1/2/3/4 cells create a group, which means
  that those digits cannot go anywhere else in that column except their marked spots.
  You can use this for restrictive purposes on regions that contain this column (i.e.,
  the 2nd and 8th regions). Pleasantly, this gives us the following:</p>
<img class="m special" src="dia/irregdia3.png" alt="Irregular Column Deduction">
<p class="parappa">You may be noticing ways to move forward by now. If you do, then I
  highly encourage you to continue on your own and analyse the rest of this example's
  regions for yourself.</p>
