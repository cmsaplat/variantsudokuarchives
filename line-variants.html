<h1 id="top">Line Sudoku Variants</h1>

<p>Have you ever seen a Sudoku grid with a bunch of squiggly lines on the screen? Green,
  magenta, orange, maybe some odder colours like grey? Those lines usually indicate
  <i>restrictions unique to specific cells (as in the cells that they cover)</i>.
  However, every line has its different restrictions--we'll be covering the most
  common ones in this webpage.</p>

<br><br><h2 id="germanwhisper">German Whispers</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, every digit on a line must differ
  from its neighbour (on the line) by at least 5 (inclusive). Digits on a line can repeat
  if allowed by classic sudoku rules.
<br>+ German Whisper lines are normally green, specifically neon green, though
  it may be different depending on the setter's stylistic preferences.</p>
<p>There are a few interesting tidbits about this variant, which are all useful
  for solving.</p>
<div class="hints"
<p class="parappa">Firstly, because of the digits we're limited to (1-9, as per classic sudoku
  rules), the digits on the line go in an up-and-down pattern (up being above 5, down
  meaning below 5). This means that, once you have a number down, you can usually
  get a general scope of the rest of the numbers on the line.</p>
<img class="region" src="dia/germanwhisperdiagram.png" alt="Up-and-Down Depiction">
<p class="parappa">This represents an ideal situation, where, with this information,
  you're able to ascribe digits to certain line cells.</p>
<img class="region" src="dia/germanwhisperdia2.png" alt="Filling In Numbers">
<p class="parappa">Secondly, only specific digits can go on the line. You can't put a
  5 on any point of a german whisper line without the rest of the line being unsolvable.
  4s and 6s can only go on the ends or (region-crossing) turns of a line, because
  the values before and after them are forced to be the same (i.e., 949 or 161)--this
  would break classic sudoku rules. You can use this to fill in the region above:</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="renban">Renbans</h2>
<p><i>Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, every digit on a line must be
  consecutive, though not necessarily placed in order.
<br>+ Renban Lines are normally magenta, specifically neon magenta, though
  it may be different depending on the setter's stylistic preferences.</i></p>
<p>Renbans on higher levels have a tendency to be abstract, but for simplicity's sake,
  we'll be covering the strategies you'd see in a lower or intermediate level
  renban sudoku.
<br><br>Firstly, on renban lines with 1s or 9s, it's best to think of that line as
  "branching out" from said digit. For example, if you had a renban line that was five
  cells long and the digit 1 was on it, then the digits on that line must be 1, 2, 3,
  4, and 5.
<br><br>Secondly, if a renban line has been given two non-consecutive digits, then
  all digits in between those two <i>must</i> be on the line.
<br><br>Thirdly, if said renban is restricted to one column, row, or box, then
  the given numbers must be completely eliminated from the renban. This means that
  any consecutive string containing said number <i>cannot</i> be the solution to that
  line (note that this doesn't mean individual digits can't go on that line--just that
  string in particular). This usually isn't as useful as the other two above, but
  it's good to keep in mind, especially for cases where you may not be able to see a
  way forward with the first two strategies.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="entropic">Entropics</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, every line must contain a  set with
  a low digit (123), medium digit (456), and high digit (789). Digits on a line
  can repeat if allowed by classic sudoku rules.
<br>+ Entropic lines are normally peach-coloured, though it may be different depending
  on the setter's stylistic preferences.</p>
<p>Something odd about this variant is that its solving patterns are extremely
  dependent on the setter's style. However, the best place to start is by determining
  a lined cell's <i>parity</i>--that is, whether if it's a low, medium, or high digit.
  Think of it as marking the up-and-down of German Whisper lines.
<br><br>... and unfortunately, that is where the strategy for solving entropic lines
  diverges. Becauuse they're so versatile, there's no common use for them--their most
  common application (at least in simple variant puzzles) is their low-middle-high
  parity being used to deduce values on the line itself.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="palindrome">Palindromes</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, every line must read the
  same in both directions. Digits may repeat on palindromic lines.
<br>+ Palindromic lines are normally blue, though it may be different depending on the
  setter's stylistic preferences.</p>

<div class="hints">
<p class="parappa">The logic behind palindromes is surprisingly simple--and I don't say that with
  strings attached.
<br><br>The best way to work out a palindromic line is to first split the line in
  half. Now, notice that the palindrome's middle acts like a "point of reflection":</p>
<img class="m special" src="dia/palindia1.png" alt="Line of Reflection on a Palindrome">
<p class="parappa rules">+ Note that digits can repeat on palindromic lines--the
  colours are to indicate a digit's position, not necessarily its uniqueness.</p>
<p class="parappa">As an example, notice the 7 in R5C4. It's not on that segment of the
  palindromic line, and can't be, because it's already been placed; and because every
  reflected digit must be the same, the 7 digit cannot be on the other side of the
  palindrome.
<br><br>This means that you can a place a 7 like so (considering classic sudoku rules):</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="regionsum">Region Sums</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, every region (i.e., 3x3
  square) a line passes through must add to the same sum. Some sums must be
  deduced.
<br>+Region sum lines are normally blue, though it may be different depending
  on the setter's stylistic preferences.</p>
<div class="hints">
<p class="parappa">The best way to approach region sum lines is to treat every section of the line as
  its own pseudo-killer cage. You can use minimum/maximum killer logic on these, which
  helps give you some context for what you're looking for in said line.
<br><br>The special aspect of region sum lines is the unique way that you can identify
  minimum and maximum values using them. Take the yellow highlighted section below:</p>
<img class="m special" src="dia/regionsumdia1.png" alt="Minimum Identification Example">
<p class="parappa">You can use this to rule out some digits for each pseudo-cage.
  1/2 can't go into the cage containing 6 (as that would be 8 or lower, which would
  break the region sum line), and 9 from the 8 cage (as the 6 cage wouldn't be able
  to add to that value, also breaking the line).</p>
