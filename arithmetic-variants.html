<h1 id="top">Arithmetic Sudoku Variants</h1>

<p>For those of you who don't like math, who just read this header as we speak, don't
   worry! As the name says there is maths involved in all of these variants, but they
   all follow the <i>four basic mathematical operations</i> (aka addition, subtraction,
   multiplication, division). The most common arithmetic variants usually limit
   themselves to addition.</p>

<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, there are dotted "cages" with a small
  number on the grid--digits in these cages may not repeat, and must sum to the value
  indicated in the cage's corner.</p>
<p>Sudokus of this kind tend to not start out with many numbers, and are thus
  reliant on mathematical logic--that sounds fancy, but really, all you have to do is
  a bit of subtraction.</p>
<div class="hints">
<p class="parappa">It's important to remember that every row, column, and box contains the
  numbers 1 to 9 exactly once--this means that every individual row, column, and box
  sums to 45. When you are given a cage restricted to a single one of these domains,
  you can subtract that cage's total from 45. This gives the remainder of the
  uncaged digits within that region, giving you a "pseudo-killer cage" for additional
  deductions.</p>
<img class="region" src="dia/killerdiagram.png" alt="Killer Subtraction Technique">
<p class="parappa">45 - 10 - 24 = 11. This is the sum of the highlighted cells <i>
  within that region</i>. This techniques does not apply to cages that cross over
  columns, rows, or regions.
<br><br>You can also deduce specific values in cages without having to do any maths.
  The digits inside a cage are limited by the no-cage repeat rule, and further by
  classic sudoku rules. For example, a 4 cage can only contain the digits 1 and 3;
  likewise, a (3 celled) 24 cage can only contain the digits 7, 8, and 9.</p>
<img class="region" src="dia/killerdiagram2.png" alt="Limiting Technique">
<p class="parappa">A 3-celled 24 cage can only contain the digits 789, a 4-celled 10
  cage can only contain the digits 1234, which leaves 5 and 6 in the gaps (which does,
  in fact, sum to 11, as we proved above).</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="little-killer">Little Killer</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, there are numbers outside of the grid
  pointing at a certain diagonal; this number gives the sum of every digit along its
  indicated diagonal. Unlike normal killers, digits can repeat on little killer
  diagonals if allowed by classic rules.</p>
<p>The logic of a little killer is a bit more difficult to describe fully.
  Firstly, any little killer string that stays inside one box acts as a usual
  killer cage--it sums to the indicated number with no repeats.
<br><br>When it gets longer than 3 digits (i.e., going outside of a single region),
  this allows for repeats--and because of that, you see numbers that normally wouldn't
  even show up in your usual killer grid.
<br><br>In cases of 4-6 digits, it's helpful to do a little "brute-forcing"
  through numbers and derive deductions from those results. For example, for a large
  number, identify the lowest digits and highest digits you can use to reach the
  indicated total, and <i>then</i> use your results as a constrant on your
  classic sudoku scanning <i>(e.g., "I can't put a 9 in this box because [constraint
  given by little killer diagonal]"</i>).
<br><br>Cases of 7-9 digits are normally used to disambiguate scanning later on.
  It's best not to worry about these until you have a good chunk of the grid filled
  up through classic sudoku scanning--once you do have to worry about them, you
  can usually use a mix of normal killer deduction and little-killer only
  constraints.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="arrows">Arrows</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, there are arrows attached to circles;
  the digits along the arrow must sum to the number inside the arrow's circle. Digits
  can repeat along arrows if allowed by classic rules. Circle values may have
  to be deduced by the player.</p>
<p>Arrows use a mix of little killer AND killer techniques, which have
  already been covered in the articles above.
<br><br>However, something unique about this variant is the fact that the totals
  are <i>inside</i> the grid, and normally have to be deduced by the player. You
  can deduce these totals by looking at how many digits the arrow spans, and
  figuring out the lowest and highest numbers you could make with those squares.
  The total itself can be further limited by the size of the arrow's circle
  (it normally covers one cell, especially in simpler arrow sudokus, but can
  occasionally cover 2 or even 3 cells).</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="x-sums">X-Sums</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, there are numbers outside of the grid,
  aligned with various rows and columns; these numbers give the sum of the nearest X
  boxes, X being the nearest digit to that clue.
<br>For example, say you had a clue of 6. Valid solutions to this would be 24, or 321/312.</p>
<p>While the logic of an x-sums variant may sound intimidating, it probably has clearer
  deductive logic than most arithmetic variants.</p>
<div class="hints">
<p class="parappa">X-sums are determined by the digit closest to a sum in that sum's
  said column/row. Think of this as a pseudo-killer cage that changes size in relation
  to that digit. As a visual:</p>
<img class="m" id="thing" src="dia/xsumsgif1.gif" alt="Alternating Killer Cages">
<p class="parappa">Once you figure out what the first digit is, you can then treat it
  as a normal killer cage (subtraction, deduction inside the cage).
<br><br>In the case that you need to work backwards, then a bit of brute force is
  involved. If a column/row's sum is small, then you can run through the possibilities
  of different-sized "cages" and sort them out by possibility (<i>e.g., "Can the
  first digit of this be five? No, because [a] ..."</i>).
<br><br>If the sum is large, then subtract the sum from 45 and identify the
  pseudo-cage starting from the <i>opposite side</i> of the column. Let's go through
  an example of this technique.</p>
<img class="m" style="align:left;margin-left:0%;width:70%;height:20%;" src="dia/xsumslong1.png" alt="X-sum of 42">
<p class="parappa">You can subtract 42 from 45, giving a result of 3. The killer
  cage protruding from the right of this row must equal 3 (single 3, or a 12 pair).
  This means that the first digit is either 7 or 8.
<br><br>The possibilities for the right cage are limited by the 6 <i>also</i> coming
  from the right, which means we must consider the first digit on the right as well.
  It's impossible to start this sum with 1, and starting it with a 2 would force a 2/4
  pair on the right, which is incompatible with both cases of the left pseudo-cage.
  This narrows it down to 3, which fulfills the requirements of an 8-cell long
  pseudo-cage. Therefore:</p>
<img class="m" style="align:left;margin-left:0%;width:70%;height:25%;" src="dia/xsumslong2.png" alt="Visual of paragraph above.">
<p class="parappa">And, as a bonus, the 3-cell-long pseudo-cage on the right forces
  a 1/2 pair.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2 id="sandwich">Sandwich</h2>
<p class="rules">Classic sudoku rules apply. Additionally, there are numbers outside of the grid,
  aligned with various rows and columns; these numbers give the sum of every digit
  in-between that column/row's 1 and 9 (1 and 9 themselves excluded).</p>
<p>For this variant, it's crucial that you find out where the grid's 1s and 9s are
  first (as the killer logic plays in here). You can do this by finding an already
  existing 1 and 9, and if a sum has been assigned to that row/column, you can guess
  where its corresponding 1/9 goes in that row/column based on killer cage maximums
  and minimums (i.e., what's the least/most amount of digits I could meet this
  sum with?).</p>
